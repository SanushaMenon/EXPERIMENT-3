# EXPERIMENT-3

AIM
To understand the syntax of printing digits in deparate lines and grading students.

THEORY
To print digits we have divided the number by 10 after printing every consecutive digit.
Hence, if we switch to a new line after printing every digit then the prn comes in separate lines.

To grade the students first we take the subject marks and add it and divide it by 5 to fine the average.
Then we use if-else loop for grading them and putting them into respective grade classes.
